                 Input Query               Process & Return Answer

The architecture of the Farmwise Chatbot: The flow starts when the user submits a question via the input field. The message is sent to the backend via AJAX. The server processes the query and sends a response back, which is displayed in the chat interface. The interface updates dynamically without reloading the page.



For Hardware:

# Schematic & Circuit


#### 1. Circuit Diagram:
- **Explanation**: If you have any hardware integration (e.g., IoT sensors or microcontrollers), the circuit diagram would show how components like sensors or devices are connected to the main controller (e.g., Arduino or Raspberry Pi).

#### 2. Schematic Diagram:
- **Explanation**: This would represent the system architecture, such as how the **frontend** communicates with the **backend** (e.g., Django server), and how data flows between the **database** and the chatbot.
